			<p><b>Mentor:</b> Bradley Brecher<br>
				The team is looking for more members. To get involved, contact him at <a href="mailto:bradley.brecher@nyu.edu" target="_blank">bradley.brecher@nyu.edu</a></p>
			<p>This semester BUGS is collaborating with the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute near Albany, New York. BUGS is bringing one of their open source projects called YACS (Yet Another Course Scheduler) to NYU. Currently the NYU team is working on converting the Albert data to “YACS form”.  Along with that there is work to be done on frontend and backend so YACS can be adopted for NYU.</p>

			</a>
			<p><b>Mentor:</b> EJ Kim<br>
			  EJ’s team meets twice a week.</p>
			  <p>EJ and his team are recreating the classic 2D Soccer Physics game using Unity. In this game, players are controlled by a single button and the oly rule that applies is physics!</p>
			  <p>So far, EJ has taught his team the basics of Unity. Currently, EJ’s team is working together in smaller groups (Game play, UI, Player Control), to lay the foundation of the game. In the future, EJ hopes to customize the classic game with quirky features!</p>

			<p><b>Mentor:</b> David Klein<br>
				His project is entirely virtual and will kick off during the summer of 2018, continuing through fall, and concluding at the end of the year. Follow the repository for the latest updates. Contact David through GitHub for questions.</p>
			<p>David's project seeks to implement classic bioinformatic sequence alignment algorithms in the form of a simple open source web application. The project is named Seek Quench because it sounds like &lsquo;sequence&rsquo; and it is trying to <i>quench</i> answers that people are <i>seek</i>ing about their sequences.</p>
