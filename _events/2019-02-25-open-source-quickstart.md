“You are a coder. Open-source projects need your skills.”
By the end of this workshop, you will submit your first pull request to an Open
Source project. No special skills are required!
We are going to help you identify and work on a project/issue that matches your skills,
experience, and preferences. This workshop is open to everyone, junior or advanced coders!
Even if you don’t know how to code, we have tasks for you too!
