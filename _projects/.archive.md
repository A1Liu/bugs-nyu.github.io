### [Soccer Physics Unity Game][unity-repo]
**Mentor:** EJ Kim  
EJ’s team meets twice a week. Contact EJ at [ejk483@nyu.edu][unity-mentor] to get connected.

EJ and his team are recreating the classic 2D Soccer Physics game using Unity. In this game, players are controlled by a single button and the oly rule that applies is physics!

So far, EJ has taught his team the basics of Unity. Currently, EJ’s team is working together in smaller groups (Game play, UI, Player Control), to lay the foundation of the game. In the future, EJ hopes to customize the classic game with quirky features!
