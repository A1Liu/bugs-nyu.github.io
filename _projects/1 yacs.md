This semester BUGS is collaborating with the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute near Albany, New York. BUGS is bringing one of their open source projects called YACS (Yet Another Course Scheduler) to NYU. Currently the NYU team is working on converting the Albert data to “YACS form”.  Along with that there is work to be done on frontend and backend so YACS can be adopted for NYU.
