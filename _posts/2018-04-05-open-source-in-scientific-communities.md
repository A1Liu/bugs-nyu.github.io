## Event Abstract

The internet is changing the scientific landscape by fostering international, interdisciplinary and collaborative software development. More than ever before, software is a crucial component of any scientific result. The ability to easily share code is reshaping expectations about reproducibilityâ€”a fundamental tenet of the scientific process. Furthermore, in this new landscape, scientific communities develop open source software, mostly built and maintained by unpaid volunteers, upon which both scientists and industry increasingly depend upon for day-to-day operations.

In this lecture, Kelle Cruz will briefly provide the backstory of how these shifts have come about, describe some of the most impactful open source projects, and discuss efforts currently underway aimed at ensuring these community-led projects are sustainable and receive support. She will conclude with a discussion of the implications of these shifts for science education and academic science.
